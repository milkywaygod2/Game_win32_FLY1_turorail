Hello, thank you for downloading my asset pack!
You can use this for any project you want, including commercially.

All i ask is that you credit me, and if possible link to the download page where you got this.

If there are any adjustments you need, feel free to contact me.

==FRAMERATES==

fly_idle and fly_shoot: 24fps
particles: 12 fps

These attributes are included in the .json spritesheets, but must be remembered if you decide to work with individual .png frames
